# headhunter
A simple Roblox exploit written in C++
Everything in the C++ file is original work besides the dependencies, free for you to use.

This code uses the luau compiler from https://www.github.com/Roblox/luau

This is a fully functioning Roblox script executor, note there's no custom functions.
Identity has been raised to 7 and the exploit is fully updated as of 1/26/2022.


Quick update: I'm working on custom functions so I hope you enjoy what I have to offer, maybe join the server and say hi while I develop :)
